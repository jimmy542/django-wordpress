Django-WordPress is a project that aims to integrate WordPress with Django by using the WordPress REST API to fetch posts and display them on a Django website. The project uses Django 3.0 and WordPress 5.3.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Django and WordPress installed on your local machine. You can install Django using pip, and you can install WordPress by following the instructions on the WordPress website.

Once you have both Django and WordPress installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and run the following commands:

python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver
These commands will install the necessary Python packages, create the database tables for the project, and start the Django development server.

Using the Project
To use the project, you'll need to create a WordPress account and generate a REST API key. You can then add this key to the settings.py file in the Django project to enable the fetching of posts.

Once you have added your API key, you can run the following command to fetch posts from your WordPress site:

python
$ python manage.py fetch_posts
This command will fetch the latest posts from your WordPress site and store them in the Django database. You can then view these posts on the Django site by navigating to the "Posts" page.
